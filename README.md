The project focused on the design, simulation, and experimental implementation of a DC–DC Ćuk converter to investigate its performance under varying input and load conditions. The main goal was to study the behavior of inductor and capacitor currents, evaluate overall efficiency, and measure the Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) of the output. Initially, the converter was modeled and simulated in MATLAB/Simulink and PLECS to understand its dynamic response, voltage inversion characteristics, and energy transfer between components. The open-loop simulation provided insights into switching waveforms, voltage ripples, and current stresses, helping to optimize component values before hardware realization. For the hardware setup, MOSFET gate signals were generated using a Wavect controller interfaced with a custom-designed driver board, fabricated on a PCB using Altium Designer. A Chroma programmable power supply provided a variable input (0–48 V), and an electronic load was employed to test different loading conditions. Input and output voltages and currents were measured using a power analyzer, while switching signals were monitored on an oscilloscope. During testing, minor inconsistencies were observed in the gate pulse pattern, which were corrected by adjusting the controller parameters. After resolving these issues, the system was operated in closed-loop mode to achieve stable, regulated output voltage. The hardware was analyzed for voltage and current waveforms, efficiency under different operating conditions, and THD to evaluate power quality. The experimental results closely aligned with simulation data, confirming the accurate performance of the Ćuk converter and demonstrating its suitability for energy conversion applications.
